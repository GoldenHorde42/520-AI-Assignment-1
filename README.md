To run this assignment, simply run python main.py. This will solve "mazefile1.obj" using Repeated forward A* and Adaptive A* and generate 2 GIFS (visualization) for the same. This is available in the plots directory.
If you comment the top half, uncomment the bottom half and run the file, it will run a comparision between Adaptive A* and Repeated Forward and store it in the log file "AdaptiveAstar_2.txt"
If you run minHeap.py you will get it's implementation on a sample test case. (this is our attempt at creating a min heap for implementing a priority queue)
