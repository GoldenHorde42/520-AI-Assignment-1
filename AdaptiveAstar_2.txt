I solved 284 mazes and the other 216 were blocked
agent 1 took 522.94 moves on average
Of the 216 blocked mazes, the number of moves by agent 1 were greater than the number of unblocked cells squared 0 times.
agent 2 took 527.88 moves on average
Adaptive A* expanded 1.0721004854235772 percent less cells than forward A* on average
Adaptive A* took 1.0958656821554946 percent less time than forward A* on average
